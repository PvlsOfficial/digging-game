# A Game About Digging a Hole â€“ Godot Edition

![Project Logo](presskit/Logo.png)  
*Low-poly / voxel-based digging game made with Godot 4.4 and Zylann's Voxel Plugin*

---

## ðŸ“– Overview

This project is a voxel-based 3D digging game inspired by *A Game About Digging a Hole*. The player digs through a procedurally generated world, collects ores and resources, upgrades equipment, and digs deeper.

The game uses Godot 4.4 and the `godot-voxel` addon by Zylann for performant voxel terrain generation. The visual style is deliberately low-poly / voxel for clarity and performance.
